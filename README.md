# Predicting-Movie-theme-Similarity-from-Plot-Summaries
Predicting Movie Theme Similarity using plot summaries from IMDB and Wikipedia.


Most people have a preference for movies of a similar genre. Movies within a genre often share common base parameters.

In this project, I quantified the similarity of movies based on their plot summaries available on IMDb and Wikipedia, then separated them into groups, also known as clusters. Then created a dendrogram to represent how closely the movies are related to each other.
